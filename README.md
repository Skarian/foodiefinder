    Recipe sites are inundated with ads and information that is distracting.

    This is a convenient and private desktop application built in Tauri to find recipes from a search bar, scrape the important information and save them locally to your machine.

### Built With

- Rust
- Tauri
- Next.js / React

### Why Built This

Honestly I wanted to practice Rust and also build something useful for my fiancee. She was the inspiration here. Getting married in 2024 <3

### Platforms

- Only tested on MacOS

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

1. Must have python 3.11 installed
2. Must have Rust and toolchain installed

### Build the application

1. Get a free Edamam API Key (no credit card required) at [https://www.edamam.com/](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/github_username/repo_name.git
   ```
3. Add `app_id` and `app_key` environment variables in `/src-tauri/.env`. Example below
   ```sh
   app_id=c5re916e
   app_key=19bb82b76d80a3185f88d3c2daef6315
   ```
4. Install python dependencies `pip install recipe-scrapers`
5. Install NPM dependencies `npm install`
6. Run `cargo tauri build`
7. The executable will be under the target folder: `/src-tauri/target/`. Feel free to move it wherever you prefer

This was just a quick side project. Not really looking for it to be a major open-source project but if there is community interest here I am happy to continue development.
